Real-Time Object Detection with Python GUI

A real-time object detection system using a webcam feed, powered by YOLOv5 and built with OpenCV and a user-friendly Tkinter GUI. This project detects common objects in live video, displays bounding boxes, object counts, and FPS — all within an interactive desktop app.
